## Abstract
This repository contains python code for the ["Learning a Non-Negative Sparse Graph for Linear Regression"](http://www.yongxu.org/paper/Learning%20a%20Non-Negative%20Sparse%20Graph%20for%20Linear%20Regression.pdf). Here is an original Matlab [code](http://www.yongxu.org/code/Learning%20a%20%20Non_Negative%20Sparse%20Graph.rar).
